referring to fig1 , an example weaving assembly 10 is used to weave a woven structure 14 . the weaving assembly 10 includes a wand 18 , a base 22 , and a plurality of warp fiber arms 26 . when weaving the woven structure 14 , the wand 18 positions a fill fiber 30 between warp fibers 42 . the fill fiber 30 extends from a spool 34 through a bore 38 in the wand 18 . the wand 18 , in this example , is a hollow tube . a fill fiber feed device may be included to meter the feed rate of the fill fiber with respect to the instantaneous relative velocity of the wand tip to the textile being created . the warp fibers 42 are manipulated by warp fiber arms 26 . the assembly 10 includes a positional controller 46 associated with the wand 18 , a positional controller 50 associated with the warp fiber arms 26 , and a positional controller 54 associated with the base 22 . the positional controller 46 is able to move the wand 18 relative to the warp fiber arms 26 and the base 22 . the positional controller 50 is able to move the warp fiber arms 26 relative to the wand 18 and the base 22 . the positional controller 54 is able to move the base 22 relative to the wand 18 and the warp fiber arms 26 . the positional controllers 46 , 50 , and 54 can be operated independently from each other or together . the warp fiber arms 26 may be on the positional controller 50 , attached to the fill fiber wand controller 46 , or attached to the base positional controller 54 . in this example , at least the positional controller 54 is a six - axis controller , and may be a six - axis robotic controller . that is , the positional controller 54 is able to move the base 22 relative to the warp fiber arms 26 in three dimensions and rotate around three axes . the positional controllers 46 and 50 may have similar characteristics . referring to fig2 - 8 with continuing reference to fig1 , the woven structure 14 includes multiple picks 58 . in this example , warp fibers 42 are crossed over a first section 62 of the fill fiber 30 to form one of the picks 58 a . the warp fiber arms 26 are actuated to cross the warp fibers 42 over the fill fiber 30 , which entraps the fill fiber to form the pick 58 a . the example fill fibers 30 and warp fibers 42 may be composed of several different materials including glass , graphite , polyethelene , aramid , ceramic , boron . one of the fill fibers 30 or warp fibers 42 may include hundreds or thousands of individual filaments . the individual filaments may have diameters that range from 5 to 25 microns , although boron filaments may be up to 142 microns in diameter . in this example , each of the warp fiber arms 26 holds one of the warp fibers 42 . in other examples , the warp fiber arms 26 may hold several of the warp fibers 42 . after crossing the warp fibers 42 over the fill fiber 30 , the warp fiber arms 26 hand - off the warp fiber 42 to another of the warp fiber arms 26 . the \u201c hand - off \u201d feature allows an open shed so that the warp fiber arms 26 do not interfere with the wand 18 . after the hand - off , the warp fiber arms 26 are then crossed over a second section 62 b of the fill fiber 30 to form another of the picks 58 b . the warp fiber arms 26 engage portions of the warp fibers 42 . these portions may include end fittings . the warp fiber arms 26 grab the end fittings holding the warp fibers 42 . the end fittings may be placed on a holding station to help maintain the position of the warp fibers 42 during weaving . a person having skill in this art and the benefit of this disclosure would understand how to create picks by crossing warp fibers over a fill fiber , and how to hand - off a warp fiber from one warp fiber arm to another warp fiber arm . when weaving , the wand 18 moves the fill fiber 30 past the warp fibers 42 . the wand 18 moves the fill fiber 30 back and forth to create built - up layers of picks 58 . the wand 18 is long enough to reach down through the longest warp fibers 42 during the weaving ( fig8 ). in this example , the base 22 is moved as dictated by the design of the woven structure 14 to create a bend 66 in the woven structure 14 . the base 22 is thus capable of movement relative to the warp fiber arms 26 . a boss 68 of the base 22 directly engages one end of the warp fibers 42 . the warp fibers 42 are adhesively secured to base 68 in some examples . the base 22 moves so that the pick_formation point is at a position relative to the wand 18 , and the fill fiber 30 , appropriate for forming the bend 66 . although only one substantial bend 66 is shown , the base 22 may manipulate the pick formation points to form a woven structure having various contours . the base 22 may move the warp fibers 42 over a piece of tooling shaped to the final desired contour [ e . g ., a mandrel ] that is attached to the base 22 to facilitate forming the bend 66 . the mandrel may move separately from the base 22 . in another example , the base 22 moves the warp fibers 42 without a mandrel to free - form the bend 66 . in some examples , the warp fibers 42 are rigid enough to cantilever out from the base 22 ( or shed ) during the weaving . a binding agent such as polyvinyl alcohol is used , in some examples , to provide a degree of rigidity to the warp fibers 42 . the warp fibers 42 may have a fixed length . the fill fiber 30 , by contrast , can have length in excess of that needed to produce one component . in some examples , the warp fibers 42 are soft and not rigid enough to cantilever out from the base . in other examples , metallic or plastic fittings may be added to the free ends of flexible warp fibers 42 . the fittings may be placed in holding stations , and the warp arms move the fittings from notch to notch as appropriate as the component is build up . the fittings may take the form of a bead with a through - hole . prior to weaving , the ends of the warp fibers 42 are inserted through the holes and bonded with an adhesive . the holding station may be a fixture that has notches to hold the non - rigid warp fibers by draping the fitting over the notch and having gravity provide tension . the fittings may also take the form of mechanisms that provide tension by the action of a spring , similar to carriers that hold spools of fiber on a braiding machine . the holding station may be attached to the base or may be independent of the motion of the base . the path and manipulations of the base 22 with the positional controller 54 , the number of warp fibers 42 engaged by the warp fiber arms 26 when forming each pick , and the sequence of warp fiber arm movements may be designed and pre - planned in a software model to produce the woven structure 14 having the desired contours . a stable shape is obtained by the interplay of fiber forces and friction within the textile unit cells throughout the component . the software model may utilize as inputs : a cad definition of the surfaces of a desired component incorporating the woven structure ; a definition of the initial warp fibers &# 39 ; lengths , locations , and orientations ; and a definition of a textile repeating unit cell ( or pick ). the software calculates motions of the wand 18 , base 22 , and warp fiber arms 26 necessary to achieve desired contours in the woven structure 14 , without colliding into each other . the software model is then used as input for the positional controllers 46 , 50 , and 54 . fig9 a - 9c show an example of the manipulation and sequencing used when weaving to create the woven structure 14 . the warp fibers 42 of this example may be attached to a base having a profile matching a portion of the woven structure 14 . the fill fiber 30 is then moved through the warp fibers 42 in multiple passes . the warp fibers 42 are then turned about an axis a in a direction d to develop , for example , a flange of the woven structure 14 and the bend 66 . fig1 shows an example warp manipulation station 70 having four warp fiber arms 26 a - 26 d . two of the arms 26 a and 26 c selectively engage the warp fiber 42 a , and two of the arms 26 b and 26 d selectively engage the warp fiber 42 b . each of the arms 26 a - 26 d may have a gripper 74 in order to push and pull the respective - warp fiber 42 a or 42 b over the fill fiber 30 . in this example , after forming a pick , the arm 26 a hands - off the warp fiber 42 a to the arm 26 d , and the arm 26 c hands - off the warp fiber 42 b to the arm 26 b . by handing off and retracting , the warp arms divide the warp fibers 42 a and 42 b to open a shed area between the warp fibers 42 a and 42 b for the wand 18 . separation s 1 between arms 26 a and 26 b , and separation s 2 between arms 26 c and 26 d can be adjusted to adjust the shape of the woven structure 14 . the separations s 1 and s 2 may remain relatively consistent when forming the area shown in fig5 . the separations s 1 and s 2 may be gradually increased after each pass of the fill fiber 30 to create a flanged area of the woven structure 14 shown in fig4 . referring to fig1 , in some examples a woven structure 14 a may include multiple layers of the warp fibers 42 . the fill fiber 30 joins all three layers in this example . grippers used when weaving the woven structure 14 a selectively engage one , two , or more warp fibers . in another embodiment the warp fiber arms 26 a - 26 d may be mounted on a housing with the fill fiber wand 18 . the warp fiber arms 26 a - 26 d may have small paddle extensions that can be inserted next to the warp fibers 42 , and are under multi - axis position control with respect to the fill fiber wand 18 , to nudge and guide the warp fibers 42 into position as dictated by the software model of the component being created . features of the disclosed examples include a relatively precise and repeatable mechanized process that is conducive to high volume production of complex shape engine components . creation of textile architectures that avoid the pitfalls of traditional methods of low intralaminar and interlaminar properties is enabled . the preceding description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature . variations and modifications to the disclosed examples may become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not necessarily depart from the essence of this disclosure . thus , the scope of legal protection given to this disclosure can only be determined by studying the following claims .
